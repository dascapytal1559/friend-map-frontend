// A missing file, or one that is not valid JSON, is no setting chosen; a value
// that is not one of its setting's own is left out, and so is a setting no
// longer kept (Name placement's "name-placement", gone since names always
// stand in for their icons), which a page still open from before may send and
// is let pass unsaved. Written by the page (PUT
// /api/view-settings, one change at a time in the order sent, each replacing
// the file whole), read afresh for every page served (savedSettingsPlugin.ts)
// and on GET /api/view-settings, and built into the demo as its defaults.
