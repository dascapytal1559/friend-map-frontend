// A person's messages across platforms, or one group chat's, laid out as a
// messaging app does: oldest at the top, newest at the bottom, under a heading
// per local day.
// This is the page's only view of message text and attachment files (the
// archive's content path): photos and GIFs as thumbnails that open larger,
// videos and voice messages as players, other files as links. Each loads only
// when it is scrolled near or played. What they said in group chats is shown
// only with `groups`, and Marketplace chats only when you ask for them;
// the name of the group each was said in opens that group (`onOpenGroup`). A
// group chat's own messages name every sender and leave out the platform, since
// a group is on one.
// With `fold`, the chat sits under a "Messages · 120" heading that opens and
// closes it (the person panel's, closed to start): nothing is asked of the
// archive until it is first opened, and closing it again keeps what has loaded.
// Its controls (`fold.tools`, the panel's "Show group messages", and "Load
// all") sit inside it, on a line above the chat, shown only while it is open.
// Messages come a page at a time, newest first: the first page as soon as the
// chat opens, and each older one as the reader scrolls near the top; "Load all"
// fetches the rest of the history in big pages. When new messages come in (a
// live chat), they are added at the bottom, and everything loaded stays.
// Opened at a moment instead (`moment`, a chip in the Table's Who), the chat loads a page
// on each side of it and scrolls to what it marks there (the call or the
// hangout), outlined; newer pages then come as the reader scrolls near the
// bottom, as older ones do at the top, and new messages wait until the chat has
// paged down to its newest.
//
// The chat scrolls in its own box, at the end of the person panel, so that it
// can open at its bottom while the panel opens at the person's name. The box is
// a reversed flex column, so the browser measures its scroll from the bottom:
// it starts at the newest message with no jump, and an older page arriving, or
// a player above growing as it loads, leaves the message in view where it is.
//
// A person's calls in no chat (the phone's call history, and an app's call
// with several people, `calls`) sit among the messages at their time, "Call ·
// 3 h 12 min" or "Missed call", an app's with the app and how many others were
// on it ("WhatsApp · with 2 others"): all of them once the whole
// history has loaded, else those since the oldest message loaded. The calls
// you logged sit there too, and so do your hangouts (`catchUps`), at their
// time or the start of their day; both open to be changed in place, and each
// day's heading offers "+ event" on that day (CatchUps.tsx). An account's own
// chat and a group chat's have no hangouts.
//
// Only the days in and near the view are drawn (`Days`), each of the rest
// standing in at its measured height, or a guess until it has been drawn, so
// tens of thousands of messages scroll as smoothly as fifty. A wrong guess above
// the view moves nothing, since the box is anchored at its bottom; one below it
// is made up for by scrolling by the difference once the day is measured.
