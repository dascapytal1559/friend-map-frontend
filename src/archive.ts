// The data contract, version 1 (docs/contract.md says it in prose, with an
// example of every answer): what a backend serves friend-map, under
// /api/archive, and the shapes of every answer and every write. The backend
// says which parts it serves in its handshake (GET /api/archive/contract, a
// Contract), and each capability lights up part of the app (CAPABILITIES,
// ROUTES); only `map` is required. A shape here is what the page works with,
// every field filled; on the wire a backend may leave out the fields
// src/contract/schema.ts marks optional, and the page fills them in.
//
// Days and months (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM) and times of day (HH:MM) are local:
// in the time zone the handshake names. "You" is the owner of the map.
//
// Two paths, kept apart on purpose:
//   /api/archive/...          structure: people, accounts, counts, dates.
//                             Never message text.
//   /api/archive/content/...  content: timelines, with message text, and
//                             attachment files.
// so a stricter policy can later be put on the content path alone.

// It imports nothing: it is the contract between friend-map and its backends.
// The life archive keeps a copy of it, pinned by its hash, so it stands on its own.
