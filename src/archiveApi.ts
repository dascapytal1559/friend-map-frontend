// The backend as the page sees it: the data contract (archive.ts, docs/contract.md) bound to the page. Every view and
// panel reaches the backend only through `archiveApi`, so where the data comes from is one choice, made once at the
// page's entry: the server's routes (archiveHttp.ts, which src/main.tsx provides), or the static demo's made-up crowd,
// held in the page itself (src/demo/archive.ts, which src/demo/main.tsx provides, and src/main.tsx in demo mode, see
// demoMode.ts). Nothing in between knows which, so the demo is the same views and panels over another source, not a
// copy of them. A method of a capability the backend does not serve (its handshake, contract()) answers
// ArchiveUnavailable, as a route it does not have answers 404. friend-map's own server, apart from any backend, is
// AppApi (appApi.ts).
//
// Two paths, kept apart on purpose:
//   structure   people, accounts, counts, dates. Never message text.
//   content     timelines, with message text, and attachment files.
// so a stricter policy can later be put on the content path alone.
