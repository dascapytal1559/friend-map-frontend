// Catch-ups, which the page calls hangouts (eventWords.ts): time you
// spent with people in person, which the message archive cannot see. Each is on a local date (at a time, when you say: shown, and
// where it sits in the chat, never in the score), with one or more people (and any
// number of others you do not name, a crowd at a wedding, say), lasted
// some hours, and may have a short note. A call is never one: it is logged as a
// call (Add event's Call, ManualCallInput). In the closeness score
// (src/demos/closeness.ts) each counts as its hours times the hour's worth
// (catchUpHourWorth in data/settings.json, settings.ts) of direct messages on
// its date, times each person's share of it (groupShare: with several people
// there, the unnamed others too, part of it is shared by all and the rest
// split equally; 3 hours with one friend and 2 others at the default half
// shared: 150 × (½ + ½ ÷ 3) = 100 for the friend). The server keeps them
// (server/archive/catchUps.ts); this is what the page and the server share.
// A day's answered calls with someone count the same way, by how long they
// were (callHours), beside any catch-up that day (callCatchUps in
// src/demos/closeness.ts).
// One may be over several days (trip: a trip away together), from
// when it began (its day and time) to when it ended (the trip's last day and
// end time), less a private window each day (asleep, time alone: midnight to
// 10 am unless you say). Each of its days counts the time together it had,
// dated that day, as a hangout of those hours on it would (tripDayHours),
// except that a trip's time together counts whole only for its first
// tripFullHours (8) and past them by its square root (tripCountedHours),
// each day keeping its part of that (catchUpCountedDayHours); it is one
// hangout, added, changed and deleted whole.
