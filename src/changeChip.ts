// The chip after a change you may want to take back, from anywhere in
// the page: archiving someone (the person panel's Archive or its tag box), or
// several at once (a group chat's "Archive untouched"), saying who or how many;
// and a tag made or deleted (in the tag manager, or by a person's tag box: a
// tag typed that nobody had, or one taken from the last person who had it,
// which deletes it), naming the tag; and a hangout (a catch-up) or a logged call added, changed or deleted
// with Add event's form (CatchUps.tsx), naming it; and someone added by hand (the
// Table's "Add person", AddPerson.tsx), naming them; and someone's location set
// or cleared (the person panel's Location, the Table's Location cell and quick
// locations), naming them and the place; and someone's identicon given a new
// colour or a new picture (the person panel's icon picker, IconPicker.tsx),
// naming them; and someone's names added to, removed, renamed or put in another
// order (the person panel's name chips, NameChips.tsx), naming the name; and a call given a length or had it
// taken away (the chat's call record, Timeline.tsx, or the Table's Calls), naming its day; and a call given a note,
// or had it changed or taken away (the Table's Calls, CallsTable.tsx), naming its day; and someone unlinked from a group chat or linked
// through it again (the person panel's break-link button, PersonGroups.tsx), naming them and the group. Undo puts back that change's changeset
// (the change log's own undo, so it is refused, saying why, when it has
// changed since: an older chip's Undo is refused while a later change depends
// on it). Each change gets its own chip, stacked (the newest at the bottom),
// each going by itself after a few seconds, or when dismissed; a refusal stays
// until dismissed. Pointing at a chip, holding it on a touch screen or moving
// into it with the keyboard holds its time. At most CHIP_STACK show: one more
// sends the oldest away early, its change still undoable from the change log.
// A save that both archives someone and makes or deletes a tag shows the
// archive (its Undo takes back the whole save). ChangeChip draws the stack
// (src/demos/page.tsx).
