// City, at /city: Orbits' closeness as a cyberspace city at night after rain,
// in the manner of Tron: Ares. Your tower stands in the middle, a monumental
// form with a core of cyan light; whoever you live with has a lit floor in
// it; everyone else is a building of dark stepped forms round it, edged in
// thin cyan light, nearer the tower the closer they are, by closeness rank on
// the scale Orbits uses, with ring roads (avenues) round the closest 10, 25,
// 50 and so on and four boulevards running out from the tower. A building's
// height is their closeness score, its footprint how much you have talked,
// both tapering away past the closest few hundred to the lights of the far
// outskirts, and the light along its edges is brightest for the closest and
// fainter tier by tier as on Orbits. The ground is wet: it mirrors the light,
// and mist drifts through the streets. Names stand over the roofs once a roof
// is big enough on the screen to carry one, of as many of the closest as the
// City's Show top names says (topNames.ts). A beam of light rises over
// everyone you should reach out to, and light runs along the roads to the
// tower from everyone you have talked with this week. Hovering a building
// shows their card, clicking opens their panel, and whoever's panel is open
// stays picked out with arcs of light to the people they share group chats
// with. It zooms and pans as Orbits does (the wheel or a pinch, a drag, the
// + − 0 keys), and the camera turns and tilts like Google Maps' (cityCamera.ts:
// a drag with the middle or right button or with Ctrl held, two fingers
// twisted or dragged up and down, and a compass to put it back); left alone,
// it drifts slowly round the city. The geometry is in cityLayout.ts, the
// camera and the forms in cityScene.ts, the drawing in cityGl.ts (WebGL 2).
