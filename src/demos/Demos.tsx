// The page around the map views: the main view (Orbits, at /orbits), the same sky

// friend circles (Circles, at /circles) and as a spider's web (the Spider web, at
// /spider, which the app opens on: DEFAULT_VIEW in views.ts), the City (/city, the same closeness
// as a cyberspace city, with everything the main view has but Methodology), the Time
// river (/time-river: messages, calls or hangouts over time in the river's look,
// with the same), and the frozen views (the river, Reciprocity), each at its
// path in src/views.ts; the
// Table view (/table) and the Calendar (/calendar) have pages of their own
// (TablePage.tsx, CalendarPage.tsx), which the app's entry gives it. Every
// view reads the archive's structure only (GET /api/archive/relationships);
// clicking a person opens the person panel, where archiving them takes them
// off every map view (the Table still lists them).
//
// This file owns the route, the header (the title, which is the view switcher,
// whose menu holds the name choice (Names) on the live views, how many people
// are shown, the main view's find box, Methodology, People on the frozen views
// alone, and under them the main view's Query bar with Hide at its end), the
// hover card, the person panel (docked beside the live views, or over the ones
// that keep their size, Orbits, Circles and the Spider web; floating over the
// frozen ones, which also open the People list); Circles has everything the main view has, following changes to people made
// elsewhere (the CLI), and the usage record. On the demo's pages (/demo in the
// app, and the static demo's, demoMode.ts) the archive is the made-up crowd's,
// only the demo's views are offered (DEMO_VIEWS in views.ts: Orbits, the solar
// system at /orbits-3d, and the Spider web), the name choice is the demo's own
// (First L. to start with, and no No name except…), and the Query bar's box offers examples. Each view lives in its own
// file and is listed in DEMOS.
