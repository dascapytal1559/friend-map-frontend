// Methodology: how the main view works, read-only, opened from the header.
// At a glance it shows how the closeness score adds up (messages plus time
// together, fading with age, ranked into distance from the sun), each piece a
// button that opens its part below. The parts, all closed when the panel
// opens, each say in one line what they are and, opened, show how they work as
// small tables, formulas, worked numbers and, wherever a rule is a function, a
// curve of it (Curve.tsx) rather than paragraphs (closeness.ts, catchUps.ts),
// with the current settings from data/settings.json, so the curves move when
// they change; then the rest of the map, who is shown, the Query bar and the
// settings, and last the Decision history (decisions.ts): what each rule was
// chosen from, kept as it was decided. Nothing here is editable; the settings
// are changed in the file.
