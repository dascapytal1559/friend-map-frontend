// Orbits, at /: the main view, and the only one that gets new work (the
// others are frozen; see AGENTS.md). You are the sun and everyone you
// talk to circles it. Distance is closeness (closeness.ts): the closer
// someone's score, the nearer the sun, by rank, with rings round the closest
// 10, 25, 50 and so on. Size is how much you have talked, and a soft
// glow in their own colour marks everyone you should reach out to. Everyone is drawn as
// their identicon, the closest strongest, fainter ring by ring, their name
// with them, tinted its colour. A comet trail runs from where someone sat at the start of the
// look-back window (trendMonths in data/settings.json) to where they sit now,
// warm if they moved in, cool if out. Nothing else places anyone: people are
// spread evenly round the sun in name order, or, on the Circles page (at
// /circles, the same map), in friend circles (friendCircles.ts), each marked
// by an arc round the outside. Methodology (Methodology.tsx) spells all this
// out on the page.
//
// OrbitMap draws the sky as of now, and moves people along their orbits when
// it changes. It zooms and pans: places spread out from the sun while the
// sun, names and labels keep their size, and markers grow only until their
// identicons can be read, so zooming in opens room and more people are named.
// The geometry is in orbitsLayout.ts, the zoom's maths in orbitsZoom.ts.
