// Orbits 3D, at /orbits-3d: Orbits (Orbits.tsx) as a solar system. It opens
// exactly as Orbits does, seen from straight above: the same people in the
// same places (orbitsSky.ts places everyone for both views), the sun, the
// rings, the glows, the trails and the names. Then the camera moves as the
// City's does (cityCamera.ts): a drag with the middle or right button, or
// with Ctrl held, turns the sky round the sun and tilts it; two fingers
// twisted or dragged up and down do the same on a touch screen; and as it
// tilts, the discs round into spheres lit by the sun, each on an orbit that
// leans a little out of the plane by its own inclination (orbits3dScene.ts),
// so the disc opens into a system with depth, the rings become ellipses, and
// the names move into the scene (orbits3dNames.ts): each in its person's
// place, facing the camera, hidden by whatever is nearer. The compass in the bottom-left corner glides the camera back to
// straight above, where it is Orbits again; `?tour=` in the address plays a
// scripted camera move from straight above, for recording a clip
// (orbits3dTour.ts). Everything else is Orbits':
// hovering shows the card, a click opens the panel, whoever's panel is open
// stays picked out with their group-chat lines, the find box, the Query bar,
// Hide, the settings and demo mode apply, and it zooms and pans the same way
// (orbitsZoom.ts).
//
// Drawn on three layers: an SVG beneath for what lies in the sun's plane
// (the rings, the trails, the lines to whoever is picked out), a WebGL
// canvas for the sun, the glows, the spheres and, tilted, the names
// (orbits3dGl.ts), and an SVG above for the text that stays flat (the ring
// labels, and from straight above the names, as Orbits
// draws them), which keeps Orbits' own type and styles. Loaded only when
// opened (Demos.tsx), so no other view carries it.
