// The Query bar under the header of Orbits and the Table: one box, where
// you say who to show in words (plain text: you dictate into it), and on
// the Table Hide, together at the right (the maps follow the Table's Hide). Its placeholder is "Query in natural language".
// Enter (or the go button inside the box, at its right edge, pressable only
// with words in it) has the model write a SQL query from the words (POST
// /api/archive/query/generate) and runs it straight away: the view shows those
// people and the line under the box says how many show after Hide and what the model
// could not put in the query, or nothing changes and the line says why. The
// query itself is never shown. Shift and Enter is a new line; Esc puts back the
// words of the query that ran. × (while the box holds words or a query is on)
// goes back to everyone. With a backend that has no model (no `query.generate`,
// docs/contract.md), the words are the query: the query language, run as typed.
// The box grows wider with its longest line, into the bar's free width, and
// grows down over the page to show all it holds while typed in; the line under
// it moves down with it. The query runs in the server (GET /api/archive/query)
// over everyone, archived people too, and runs again whenever people or
// messages change; one that stops running (a tag deleted, say) leaves nobody
// shown until it is changed. Hide (HidePanel.tsx) is the last gate, after the
// query. The bar takes the view's Hide: each query, and the query again
// whenever Hide changes, is counted under Hide, and the line says how many it
// shows after Hide as it was when the query ran; Hide changing later leaves the line as it was. On the map the bar also takes
// a limit: a query that would show more than the limit after Hide is refused
// before any of it loads, the view keeping what it shows; the box turns red, the
// line saying why, until the words or Hide change.
