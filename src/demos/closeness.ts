// The closeness score: how close you are to each person, from who wrote
// what where and when, never from what was said, and from the catch-ups you
// had with them outside messages. It sets how far from the sun everyone sits
// on Orbits. Pure functions, no DOM.
//
//   closeness = Σ over every month of direct messages:          direct × ½^(age ÷ half-life)
//             + Σ over every group message between you and them: weight × ½^(age ÷ half-life)
//             + Σ over every catch-up you had with them:          worth × ½^(age ÷ half-life)
//
//   direct = (1 − r) × (yours + theirs) + r × 2√(yours × theirs)
//            that month's direct messages each way, weighed by how evenly
//            you both wrote (directWeight): r is messageReciprocity in
//            data/settings.json (1 by default). At 1, 50 each way counts
//            100, as plainly counted, 90 and 10 count 60, 99 and 1 count
//            20, and 100 from one side alone counts nothing; at 0 every
//            message counts 1. Each month on its own, before fading, so a
//            friendship gone one-way lately counts less now and its even
//            years still count as they were.
//   weight = your share ÷ others   a message they sent in a group chat you are both in
//          = their share ÷ others  a message you sent in a group chat they are in
//   worth  = how many direct messages a catch-up counts as: its hours times the
//            worth of an hour (catchUpHourWorth in data/settings.json,
//            src/catchUps.ts), times each one's share of it with n people
//            there (you not counted, the others you did not name counted):
//            s + (1 − s) ÷ n (groupShare, s = groupSharedPart, ½ by
//            default), part of it shared by all and the rest split
//            equally: 2 hours with 4 people is 100 × (½ + ½ ÷ 4) = 62.5
//            each; 3 hours with 1 friend and 2 others is 100 for the
//            friend. A trip (several days away together) counts each of
//            its days apart, dated and fading on its own: that day's
//            time together, from when it began to when it ended less the
//            private window (midnight to 10 am by default), its first
//            8 hours (tripFullHours) whole and the rest by their square
//            root, F × √(hours ÷ F) (tripCountedHours), shared out over
//            its days by their time together: a whole day away with one
//            friend is 14 hours, 529; ten of them, 1,673
//
// A day's answered calls with someone count the same way, by how many hours
// they were connected in all (callHours in src/catchUps.ts; a day under
// callMinimumMinutes counts nothing; callCatchUps), beside any catch-up with
// them that day. A day's calls are the phone's call history's and the other
// apps' in one-to-one chats whose length is known (Messenger's and
// Instagram's, and any you gave a length) and those you logged, added up
// together, a phone call you logged that the call history brings in too
// counted once (callDays in the life archive's server/archive/calls.ts); every
// call record in a one-to-one chat counts as no message, so one whose length
// is not known counts nothing. A call you logged with several people (and any
// you did not name on it) adds to each one's day their share of
// its time (groupShare: an hour with three, at half shared, 40 minutes each;
// callDaySeconds), as a catch-up's worth is shared out, before the shortest
// day that counts and the hour's worth apply.
//
// A share is the share of that group's messages someone wrote, up to the
// month being scored. Each side's messages are credited by how active the
// other side is there, as a rough guess at how much of what each says is
// addressed to the other. A group adds, for each member P,
//
//   (P's messages × your share + your messages × P's share) ÷ others
//
// So a group you never write in adds nothing, and a member who never writes
// there gets nothing from yours either. "Others" is how many people are in the
// group besides you: a message to a group is split among everyone in it, so
// no group message ever weighs more than a direct one. Other members'
// messages to each other are not between you and them and count for nobody.
// Marketplace chats and system messages count nothing
// (the report leaves them out).
//
// Some sources hold only your own messages (Discord's data package:
// conversation.is_self_only), so what anyone else wrote there is not known.
// The score assumes an even exchange: each of your messages in a one-to-one
// chat there counts 2, yours and an assumed reply (what an even month counts,
// whatever messageReciprocity); in a group chat there, every
// other member is taken to have written as many as you did each month, so each
// of the n people in it (you too) holds a 1/n share, and the formula above
// gives each member  2 × your messages ÷ n ÷ others.
//
// The half-life is closenessHalfLifeDays in data/settings.json (90 days by
// default): a message that old counts half, twice that a quarter. The report
// gives counts by month, so every message is dated at the middle of its month
// (the current month: halfway through the part of it gone by), and a past
// month is scored as of its last day. A catch-up is dated at the middle of its
// own date.
//
// The score alone never places whoever you live with (tagged
// "live-together"): they are infinitely close, ranked first whatever it is
// (closenessRanks), and Orbits sets them right next to the sun.
