// Methodology's Decision history: why the closeness score's rules are what
// they are. Each entry is one decision the user made, newest first: the
// question, the options weighed, the table they were compared on, the user's words,
// and what changed. It is a record, so its numbers are those of the day it was
// decided, never worked out from today's settings; a later decision that
// replaces one adds an entry of its own and names it in the older one's
// `replacedBy`. Add a decision as one more object at the top. No real names,
// here or in the quotes: "[a friend]" stands for one.
