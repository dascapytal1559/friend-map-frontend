// Orbits 3D's names once the view tilts (Orbits3D.tsx). From straight above
// the names are Orbits' own: flat text centred where each person's sphere
// would be, standing in for it, placed by orbitsSky's useOrbitNames and drawn
// in the SVG above the canvas. Tilted, that overlay would show a name through
// a sphere in front of it. So past a small tilt the names move into the
// scene: each in its person's place, facing the camera, drawn on the WebGL
// canvas (orbits3dGl.ts) at its person's depth, so a sphere or the sun nearer
// the camera hides it as it would anything behind it. Between the two
// the overlay fades out as the in-scene names fade in (namesInScene), so a
// nudge of the camera flips nothing. The text itself is drawn once per name
// with Canvas 2D into one atlas (NameAtlas), at the canvas's own pixel
// density, with Orbits' type, outline and glow, and sampled pixel for pixel,
// so it is as crisp as the SVG's; a name is drawn again only when it changes
// (the text, its colour, its size, whether it is picked out).
//
// The rules are pure functions, tested without a GPU; the atlas needs a
// document and is only made in the browser.
