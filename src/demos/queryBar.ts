// words, and the query the view shows (the last one that ran), which is never

// (Generate) and runs it straight away: it either shows those people, the line
// under the box saying how many and what the model could not put in the query,
// or nothing changes and the line says why. × goes back to everyone. The query that ran, and the
// words it came from, are remembered per browser, the map's and the Table's
// apart. A query that does not run, or that the map refuses because it would
// show more than its limit after Hide, is `failed` (the box and Hide turn red)
// until the words, or Hide, change, or a query runs.
