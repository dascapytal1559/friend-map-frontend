//
// The rule, in one sentence: fit a least-squares line through the window's
// monthly message counts; if the line rises by at least half the window's
// average month from its first month to its last, you are getting closer; if
// it falls by that much, drifting apart; otherwise steady. With fewer messages
// than months in the window (under one a month), there is too little to tell.
//
// "How much you talked" is the model's series: direct messages both ways plus
// what they sent in group chats. The month in progress is left out, since a
// few days in, any friendship would look like it is fading; so is a month
// before anyone's first message, which counts as none.
