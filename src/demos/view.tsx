// The kit every demo view is built from: what a view is (Demo, ViewProps),
// loading the data, the hover card's contents, labels, and the legend.
//
// A view is a component that draws `model` into a `width` x `height` stage
// (leaving `inset` pixels at the top for the page header), calls `hover`
// with a Tip while the pointer is over a person (null when it leaves), and
// `open` when a person is clicked; the page draws the hover card and opens
// the person panel. See Placeholder.tsx for the smallest working view.
