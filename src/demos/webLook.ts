// The Spider web view's drawing (Orbits.tsx with the web look), on the canvas under
// the SVG (WebLayer.tsx) with the helpers in webDraw.ts, its boot timed by
// webChoreography.ts, in Amber, the Spider web's own (amber strands, teal
// rings), or a custom colour (webColour.ts), the teal kept for the spider's
// eyes and its beams in every colour. Only the palette differs.
//
// The look: a holographic wireframe on a deep ground with a fine grid and
// scanlines, a trace of chromatic split, and a web that runs out past the
// edges of the screen (webGeometry.ts), fading toward them, as strong as the
// Web strength slider says (webStrength.ts): an orb web with as many spokes
// and its cross threads sagging as deep as its sliders say (webStyle.ts), whose rings
// are the rank rings, drawn stronger than the thinner rings between them and
// never fainter than the guide rings they stand in for, each broken where its
// label sits. The spider sits at the hub
// (webSpider.ts, on the rig in webRig.ts), growing gently with the zoom
// (SPIDER_GROWTH) so its detail can be looked at: its head looks toward
// whoever is selected (their panel open), else whoever is hovered, almost at
// once, so while someone is held hovering others turns nothing; its chassis
// follows later and slower to face whoever is selected, and anyone else
// only from beyond the cone of 90° in front of it (CONE), its abdomen
// trails, its legs keep their footholds on the web and step when the body turns, and it holds where it last turned, the cursor
// itself meaning nothing; its eyes have a life of their own (webEyes.ts), at
// rest it grooms, plucks the web, looks round, settles and flexes of its
// own, never on a loop. The Spider web boots when it opens, and again whenever
// you re-query: a flicker, then a scan line from the top of the
// stage to the bottom materialises the web as it passes and locks in everyone
// it names (its Show top names) with a bracket. Hovering someone, with nobody
// held, fires a beam at them from the spider's eyes: it runs out, locks with
// a flash, and holds, energised, until they are looked away from, when it
// breaks up. Selecting someone takes them up (webHold.ts): a line is laid
// out to them from the mouth with a little slack, draws taut and snaps with
// a flash and a twang, and holds them as an energised beam, with no reticle
// on them, a beam from the eyes on them giving way to it; deselected, it
// reels back into the mouth. While someone is held the hold is the only
// line: hovering someone else fires no beam. The square targeting reticle goes
// with the hover: it snaps onto whoever is hovered, someone held or not, and
// springs off as the pointer leaves them, but never marks whoever is held.
//
// Two canvases (WebLayer.tsx). Under the SVG, in this order: the ground, the
// web (as far as the scan has reached), halos under people, the spider, then
// a hole of the ground's colour under every marker (none under a name in its
// place), so the web ends at each
// icon's rim and never shows through it (Orbits
// draws the fainter tiers' icons translucent), and a fade under the header.
// Over the SVG (drawWebOver): the beam to whoever is hovered and the reticle
// on them, and over those the hold on whoever is selected, above everything,
// other people's icons included, as you asked. The colours, the canvas's and those of Orbits' own SVG
// marks (the sun's gradient, the markers' rims, the trails, the names), are
// the colour's theme (webTheme.ts).
