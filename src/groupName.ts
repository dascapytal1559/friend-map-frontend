// What a group chat is called in a person's panel. A group with a title goes
// by it. An untitled one, as iMessage groups often are, goes by the first few
// people in it, each as the Name format choice labels them ("Ada, Bo and 3 more"), so
// it follows that choice as every other name does. One with no name at all, a
// blank title (as an untitled iMessage group imports) or nobody to name it by,
// is "-". While names are hidden (No name except…: its title or its members
// may name anyone), a group has no name (empty, drawn as the shape a hidden
// name is).
