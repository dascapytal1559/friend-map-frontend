// Each view's own settings, by its slug (views.ts): what the menu at the top
// left (ViewSwitcher.tsx) shows in a section of its own, set apart from the
// list of views, while that view is open, and nothing for a view without any.
// A setting is data: a toggle (a choice between a few, as one row of buttons),
// a theme colour (a toggle of presets and a custom colour) or a slider, each
// over a store the view itself reads, so the menu and the view stay one
// (ViewSettings.tsx draws them). A view's settings come in groups, set apart
// by a line: most views have one; the map views have their Names group
// (how names fade, one set for every view) after their first; the Spider web
// has its name settings first, then the Names group, then the web's own look.
// Every view that glows round everyone to reach out to ends with one more, the
// Reach-out glow, one setting they share. The name choice (Name format,
// NamesMenu.tsx), on every page that shows names, is put first in the first
// group by ViewSettings.tsx rather than listed here, as it is the page's, not
// one view's. Where names go is not a setting: every map view draws each
// named person as their name alone, in place of their icon. No React here but
// the stores' hooks.
