// Every view of the map: Orbits 2D, the flat sky, hidden from the switcher
// for now (`hidden`) but still at /orbits; Orbits, the same sky as a solar
// system (at /orbits-3d; its slug, "orbits-3d", is the name its usage and
// settings are kept under); the same map in friend circles (Circles), the
// same map as a spider's web (Spider web), the City (the same closeness as a
// cyberspace city), the Table of everyone, the Calendar of every day and the
// Time river (messages, calls or hangouts over time, in the river's look),
// then the frozen views, which keep working on the same data but get no new
// work. The view switcher lists them in this order, the main views
// (MAIN_VIEWS: Orbits, the Spider web and the City) first, as a group of
// their own. No React here, so the server's usage report (npm run usage) can
// read the list too.
//
// The app opens on the Spider web (DEFAULT_VIEW): the bare address, /, which is
// no view's own, leads to it, as does any address that names no view.
//
// A view that reads more of the backend than the map (`needs`) is offered only
// where the backend's handshake says it serves that (src/contract/handshake.ts).
//
// The demo (demoMode.ts) is two of this list's views again, on a made-up
// crowd: Orbits (at /orbits-3d) and the Spider web, at the root of the static
// demo's own site, the public demo (PUBLIC_DEMO). The app does not hold it: its
// switcher's Demo opens the public demo, and an old /demo address leads there
// (server/oldDemo.ts).
// It offers the views in DEMO_VIEWS, so a view added here is in the demo only
// once it is added there too.
